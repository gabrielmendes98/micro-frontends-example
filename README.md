Building Micro Frontends with React, Vue, and Single-spa

Example taken from: [Nader Dabit's post](https://dev.to/dabit3/building-micro-frontends-with-react-vue-and-single-spa-52op)

Single SPA enables you to use multiple frameworks in a single-page application, allowing you to split code by functionality and have Angular, React, Vue.js, etc. apps all living together.

The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface. - [Michael Geers](https://micro-frontends.org/#what-are-micro-frontends)

#### My conclusion

When building simple websites, which are unlikely to have many changes or are made by a single developer, there is no need to use these concepts.
However, in projects that involve many people or that may change over time, or even to make new projects more malleable in the future, the concepts of Micro Frontends and Single SPAs become very interesting.
